# Hardware Adjustment Guidance (N/A)

This project is software-only and does not require hardware adjustments.

- Environment: Windows/macOS/Linux, Python 3.11+ runtime
- No drivers, calibration, or hardware safety operations are needed
- This document exists to satisfy governance; future hardware-impacting changes must update this file and related tests
